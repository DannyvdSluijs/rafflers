A raffler written in Saffire
============================

A few fun facts:

  1. The language isn't available on all platforms (but it is on Linux 32/64bit, and OSX 64bit).
  2. The language is only partly written. In fact, some of the classes used, aren't even yet available in the development version of Saffire. However, I've decided to ignore this fact for now.
  3. This whole raffler is written 100% through github's web interface, just because it's possible.

Compiling and using Saffire itself can be found at the Saffire github repo: https://github.com/saffire/saffire and on the main site (http://saffire-lang.org)
