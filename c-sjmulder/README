Most rafflers here either
 - read the entire file into memory, then operate on it, or
 - do two passes over the file.

This one does neither, instead it takes one pass using reservoir sampling
at the cost of more rand() calls.

To compile and use:

    cc -o raffler raffler.c
    ./raffler <names.txt
